<h1>Indoor Plants</h1>
<p>
Indoor plants are great for people who have a house or an apartment and for people who don’t have much room because most of them are small-sized plants that can be relocated whenever you want to. Indoor plants can give a relaxed atmosphere to your house and they are a good supply of oxygen to everyone inside. Many of these plants don’t require too much sunlight which makes them easy to take care of inside the house.

 <h3>Peace Lily</h3><p>Full transparency: the huge white flowers of the Peace Lily are not technically flowers — they’re bracts (a modified leaf used to reproduce in the wild). However, they look like huge white flowers, and they bloom throughout the year (and a bit more frequently in the springtime). This coupled with the plant’s broad, deep green leaves and general toughness and you’ve got the ideal flowering plant for the plant newb. The plant is also great about telling you what it needs — if the leaves droop, water it; if its leaves begin to yellow, give it less sun.

 <h3>Monstera</h3><p>Monstera Deliciosa goes by many names. Whatever you call it, it’s beautiful, grows quickly and changes shape. The leaves of the Monstera will grow some, begin to develop holes, then completely open up into a wide slated leaf. Unfettered and in a proper environment, they also grow incredibly fast, so be prepared to pare back new growth to save the plants around it.</p>

 <h3>Bunny Ears Cactus</h3><p>Treat these cacti (which also go by the name Angel Wings) properly and they’ll live as long as you do. As you might expect, infrequent watering and high, direct sunlight is preferred. Its spines don’t grow far from the pads, and it shouldn’t grow more than a couple of feet tall in a home environment.</p>

 <h3>Money Tree</h3><p>This is a plant shop staple, and in being a plant shop staple we can know one thing: it is resilient as hell. While you should give your Money tree a home with decent sun exposure and you should water it when the soil dries out, it’ll still be there for you after you forget about it for a month (or more). It’s also among the fast-growing plant group, so be sure to put it in a spot that gives it room to fill out a bit.</p>
